### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nicolas Raimundo

Iâ€™m Data Analyst and also Physioterapist. My goal is to use my oldest skills and knowledge (as a sports physician) to combine it with my new skills (as a Data analyst).
However, I'm open to work in a different enviroment, just like a Fintech ( for ex.).
I have passion for data and the results that i achieve when the tools are used in the right way.
My last learning was Python and Iâ€™m currently learning about Tableau, GCP and Firestore.
